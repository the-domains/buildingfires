Building Fires is a movement working with the art of building sacred fires and gathering community around them. We do this for the earth, for the in-between worlds and for the Mystery that holds us all together.

According to an old Greek legend, any new civilization can not take shape before we go back and meet each other around the fire. We need to let the becaon of fire re-establish the connection between the realms of creation so that the true nature of our inter-relatedness can be born.
