description: "Hang on to your coffee there for a second; I think you might need it after I tell you this. Look around you, can you find anything made of iron? Maybe you're on the bus, maybe in your office or maybe in your kitchen, at any rate if you see some iron today feel it, let your fingers gently glide across it, sense it's temperature, is it smooth or ruff?"
