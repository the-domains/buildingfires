            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>by the fire · under the stars</h1><p>This week I had an experience with a horse. The horse belongs to a friend of mine, or so to speak, because in reality it belongs to life, the same way our children belong to life and not to us. This horse has caused my friend some worry as it sometimes can prove to be somewhat of a nuisance.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d23f7c1b3e95fa6b770acab403d4a54a570ffbc9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>by the fire · under the stars</h1><p>Hang on to your coffee there for a second; I think you might need it after I tell you this. Look around you, can you find anything made of iron? Maybe you're on the bus, maybe in your office or maybe in your kitchen, at any rate if you see some iron today feel it, let your fingers gently glide across it, sense it's temperature, is it smooth or ruff?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/51734127ad5e5936c98e042472db74dfa8a02b3e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>By the Fire</h1><p>There is nothing like gathering around a fire, feeling the warmth of the flames heating your body, listening to the crackling noise of the wood and wondering at the starry night sky! The fire itself is the oldest Archetype in creation; it is the Love with which we all are alive.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/617683b4-d61a-462a-80d6-dd98d2d66a67.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>by the fire · under the stars</h1><p>The small fires burning brightly across the night sky is the stars that we are made of. We are literally stardust in motion and that motion would not be possible without our closest star- the sun! Fire is essential to all that we call life!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e45aeb5ac503b0f91a7cd3eff052f3841fe7e2ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>
